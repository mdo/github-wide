# Wide GitHub

Userstyle for making all of GitHub completely fluid.

### Why

Well, we just shipped split diffs—hell yeah!—and now only part of the site is fluid. This makes it all fluid with just a bunch of CSS.

### Disclaimer

I work at GitHub. This repo comes with absolutely no promise of an official full-width interface GitHub. No such project is under way, and as you'll find with this userstyle, it's not as simple as just adding more CSS. That said, enjoy!

### How to use

Install a userstyle manager for your favorite browser:

* Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en
* Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/ (be sure to place the CSS inside the `@-moz-document domain("github.com")` block)
* Safari: http://code.grid.in.th/

Then, copy-paste the styles from `github-wide.css` into a new userstyle. Be sure to specify that it apply to sites beginning with `https://github.com/*`.

In addition, you can apply styles from `gist-wide.css` to sites beginning with `https://gist.github.com/*`.

#### Userstyles.org
